# Neural-Network

The fifth project for my Intermediate Applied Data Analysis class from the MscBMI Program at The University of Chicago focused deeply on Neural Networks. The code for this repository elaborates on the specific code used to answer questions on the aforementioned topic.

Prior to creating, tuning and testing the Neural Network, we first generated a scatterplot to better understand the data. The Neural Network had the following parameters: variable hidden layer network size (2-50), 3-fold cross validation, and decay rate of 5e-4. To visualize the accuracy and results, we deduced the AUC value and 95% CI. 

We double checked our accuracy of the Neural Network model with a Logistic Regression -- the Neural Network model greatly outperformed and so we deemed it the better model.
